SCALAR48 do not decode correctly...
  -> fixed
  
SCALAR16 and SCALAR32 also not always properly decoding
  -> mov r0, 0   -> mov reg-reg decoded instead of mov reg-imm
    -> fixed, was a copypasta
  -> add r0, 1   -> mul reg-reg
    -> fixed, Herman's notes on encoding were incorrect
    -> if we adjust the 4-bit instruction to add the padding he notes
       we get a 000100 for the 6-bit form of the instruction - mul - instead
       of the expect 000010 of add
  -> bne <label> -> ld r12, (r15)
  -> bra <label> -> st.s r2, (r7)
