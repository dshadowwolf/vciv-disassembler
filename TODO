1) Decide on project license
  -- MIT or BSD 3-clause
	-- MIT is simpler
	-- BSD 3-clause includes source/creator indemnification
2) Add tracking of current instructions address for PC-relative encodings
3) Add tracking instruction source bytes to the instructions (this is done by GNU's objdump and is a decent tool for helping find bugs)
4) Refactor to factory pattern on instruction decoders
5) Rework driver code to generic consumer-producer
