VECTOR48 and VECTOR80 implementations
  - VECTOR48 has a basic implementation, but no test available
  - limited testing is showing success, vector register decode helper is completely borked
  - start4x.elf from the RPi firmware repo has VECTOR80 instructions as well as VECTOR48 - can't easily progress with testing existing decoders with those being skipped, need to implement VECTOR80 now
-- Math system and tracking of program segment and locations for use in offset calculations
  -- perhaps a flag in the vc4_parameter result for such - maybe a second type flag for "needs calc" and then a simple expression evaluator ?
