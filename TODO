VECTOR48 and VECTOR80 implementations
  - VECTOR48 has a basic implementation, but no test available
  - limited testing is showing success, vector register decode helper is completely borked

-- Math system and tracking of program segment and locations for use in offset calculations
  -- perhaps a flag in the vc4_parameter result for such - maybe a second type flag for "needs calc" and then a simple expression evaluator ?
